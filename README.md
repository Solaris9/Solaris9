# Hai!
It seems you found my GitHub profile. Hello, I'm Solaris and I'm a hobbyist programmer who likes to learn new things.
On my profile you'll see some of the repositories I've made (or forked) for various projects.

I don't have much to say as I'm not a talkative person but that's all I have right now.
